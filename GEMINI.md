# Entity Version Control System (EVCS) Architecture 

## 1. Project Scope
This project implements a robust, Git-style version control system for relational database entities. Unlike simple audit logs, this system provides full branching capabilities, time-travel functionality, and immutable state history for complex data structures.

**Key Capabilities:**
* **Branching:** Support for parallel development of entity states (e.g., `main`, `draft`, `feature/legal-review`).
* **Time Travel:** Ability to reconstruct the state of an entity (and its related children) at any specific timestamp in the past.
* **Immutability:** Updates create new version nodes; historical data is never overwritten (APPEND-ONLY).
* **Strong Typing:** Fully typed codebase verified at compile-time.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

*   **`backend/`**: Contains the FastAPI application, database models, and versioning logic.
    *   `app/api/`: Endpoint definitions and dependencies.
    *   `app/core/`: Configuration, security, and versioning core logic.
    *   `app/models/`: SQLAlchemy ORM models and Pydantic schemas.
    *   `app/repositories/`: Data access layer implementing the versioning logic.
    *   `app/services/`: Business logic orchestrating multiple repositories.
*   **`docs/`**: Bounded-context documentation (product scope, architecture, project plan, PDCA prompts).
    *   `docs/00-meta/`: Entry point and documentation guides.
    *   `docs/01-product-scope/`: Business requirements and vision.
    *   `docs/02-architecture/`: System design, contexts, cross-cutting concerns, ADRs.
    *   `docs/03-project-plan/`: Current work, backlog, iteration history.
    *   `docs/04-pdca-prompts/`: AI collaboration templates.
*   **`old_docs/`**: Legacy documentation preserved for reference.
*   **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for database management and development tasks.

## 3. Documentation

The project uses a **bounded-context documentation structure** to minimize context rot and improve maintainability.

**Quick Navigation:**
*   **[Documentation Guide](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/00-meta/documentation-guide.md)**: How to find and maintain documentation
*   **[Product Vision](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/01-product-scope/vision.md)**: Business goals and user needs
*   **[System Map](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/02-architecture/00-system-map.md)**: High-level architecture overview
*   **[Current Iteration](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/03-project-plan/current-iteration.md)**: Active sprint status and goals
*   **[PDCA Prompts](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/04-pdca-prompts/)**: AI collaboration templates

**Detailed Documentation:**
*   **Architecture:** `docs/02-architecture/` - Bounded contexts, cross-cutting concerns, ADRs
*   **Project History:** `docs/03-project-plan/iterations/` - Completed PDCA cycles
*   **Legacy Docs:** `old_docs/` - Preserved for reference (monolithic architecture doc, historical records)

## 4. Work Process (Strict Rules)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure project health and visibility, the following rules are **MANDATORY**:
> 1.  **PDCA Alignment**: Every major change must follow the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle using the **[PDCA Prompts](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/04-pdca-prompts/)**.
> 2.  **Documentation Updates**: 
>     - Update **[Current Iteration](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/03-project-plan/current-iteration.md)** during active work
>     - Create iteration record in `docs/03-project-plan/iterations/` after completion
>     - Update **[Project Backlog](file:///home/nicola/dev/backcast_evs/docs/03-project-plan/backlog.md)** as priorities change
>     - Update architecture docs when patterns change
