## 2025-02-18 - API Documentation as UX
**Learning:** In a headless backend environment, "UX" translates directly to "DX" (Developer Experience). Clear error messages and self-documenting schemas (via Swagger/OpenAPI) are the interface developers interact with.
**Action:** Always verify that Pydantic schemas include `description` and `examples`, and that API endpoints have comprehensive docstrings explaining query parameters and constraints.
