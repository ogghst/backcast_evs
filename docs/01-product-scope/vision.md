# Product Vision: Backcast EVS

## Overview

Backcast EVS (Entity Versioning System) is a Project Budget Management and Earned Value Management (EVM) platform designed for end-of-line automation projects. The system enables comprehensive project financial tracking with Git-like versioning capabilities for complete audit trails and change order isolation.

## Business Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Provide the Project Management Directorate with a robust tool to model, test, and validate financial management processes before implementing them in production environments.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Enable data-driven decision making through comprehensive EVM metrics
- Improve project delivery predictability through early variance detection
- Support safe experimentation with change orders via branch isolation
- Maintain complete audit trails for compliance and analysis

## Target Users

1. **Project Managers** - Daily users for budget tracking, change orders, and performance monitoring
2. **Department Managers** - Access to department-specific cost elements and resource planning
3. **Project Controllers** - Read-only access for analysis and compliance reporting
4. **Executives** - Summary dashboards and portfolio-level analytics

## Core Value Proposition

**What makes this different:**
- **Git-Style Versioning:** Complete entity history with time-travel queries
- **Branch Isolation:** Test change orders safely before merging to main
- **EVM Compliance:** Full ANSI/EIA-748 standard calculations
- **Hierarchical Tracking:** Projects → WBEs (machines) → Cost Elements (departments)

## Success Criteria

The system succeeds when it:
- Accurately simulates complex project scenarios
- Validates business rules under various conditions
- Generates EVM calculations matching manual results
- Supports training on EVM principles
- Provides foundation for continuous process improvement

## Business Context

End-of-line automation projects involve multiple machines sold as integrated solutions. Each machine requires independent budget tracking while contributing to overall project performance. The system must handle:

- Revenue allocation across Work Breakdown Elements (WBEs)
- Departmental budget tracking via Cost Elements
- Change order processing with impact analysis
- Quality event cost tracking
- Baseline management at project milestones
