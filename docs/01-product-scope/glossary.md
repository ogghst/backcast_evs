# Glossary

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Purpose:** Define domain terms, acronyms, and EVM terminology

---

## Project Structure Terms

**Project**  
Top-level container for all financial and structural data. Represents a complete customer order for end-of-line automation equipment.

**Work Breakdown Element (WBE)**  
Individual machine or major deliverable sold to customer within a project. Primary organizational unit for budget allocation and performance measurement.

**Cost Element**  
Represents a specific department or discipline responsible for delivering portions of work within a WBE. Most granular level of budget tracking and cost imputation.

**Branch**  
Isolated workspace for modifying project data. Types: main (production), co-{id} (change orders).

**Control Date**  
Selected date determining what data is visible/calculable. Supports time-travel queries.

---

## Financial Terms

**BAC (Budget at Completion)**  
Total planned budget for work scope. Sum of all allocated budgets adjusted for approved changes.

**EAC (Estimate at Completion)**  
Expected total cost at project completion based on current performance and forecasts.

**ETC (Estimate to Complete)**  
Expected cost to finish remaining work. Calculated as `EAC - AC`.

**Baseline**  
Snapshot of project data at a specific milestone, used for variance tracking and performance measurement.

**Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)**  
Time-phased budget plan against which performance is measured (EVM compliance).

---

## EVM Metrics

**PV (Planned Value) / BCWS (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled)**  
Authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. What you planned to accomplish.

**EV (Earned Value) / BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed)**  
Budgeted cost of work actually performed. What you actually accomplished (in budget terms).

**AC (Actual Cost) / ACWP (Actual Cost of Work Performed)**  
Realized cost incurred for work performed. What you actually spent.

**CPI (Cost Performance Index)**  
Cost efficiency indicator. `CPI = EV / AC`. >1 is good (under budget), <1 is concern (over budget).

**SPI (Schedule Performance Index)**  
Schedule efficiency indicator. `SPI = EV / PV`. >1 is good (ahead), <1 is concern (behind).

**CV (Cost Variance)**  
`CV = EV - AC`. Negative = over budget, Positive = under budget.

**SV (Schedule Variance)**  
`SV = EV - PV`. Negative = behind schedule, Positive = ahead of schedule.

**VAC (Variance at Completion)**  
Expected final cost variance. `VAC = BAC - EAC`.

**TCPI (To Complete Performance Index)**  
Required cost performance on remaining work to meet budget goals. Two versions: based on BAC or EAC.

---

## Versioning Terms

**Head Table**  
Stores stable entity identity and current state pointers. Example: `User`, `Project`.

**Version Table**  
Stores immutable historical snapshots of entity state. Example: `UserVersion`, `ProjectVersion`.

**Valid From / Valid To**  
Temporal validity range for a version record. `valid_to = NULL` indicates current version.

**Composite Primary Key**  
Primary key consisting of multiple columns. Examples: `(id, branch)` for heads, `(head_id, valid_from)` for versions.

**Time Travel**  
Ability to query entity state at any historical point in time using temporal validity ranges.

**Deep Copy**  
When creating a branch, all entities are copied from main to new branch, ensuring complete isolation.

**Merge**  
Applying changes from a branch back into main branch. Atomic operation (all-or-nothing).

---

## Change Order Terms

**Change Order**  
Formal request to modify project scope, budget, or schedule. Creates isolated branch for safe experimentation.

**Change Order Branch**  
Isolated workspace (`co-{id}`) where change order modifications are made before merging to main.

**Branch Lock**  
Prevents modifications to a branch. Used when branch should be read-only (e.g., under review).

**Impact Analysis**  
Assessment of change order effects on budgets, schedules, and EVM metrics before approval.

**Merged View**  
Unified display showing entities from both main and branch with change status indicators (unchanged/created/updated/deleted).

---

## Quality Management Terms

**Quality Event**  
Incident requiring additional costs without corresponding revenue increase. Examples: rework, defect correction, warranty work.

**Cost of Quality**  
Total costs attributable to quality events as percentage of total project costs.

**Root Cause**  
Fundamental reason a quality event occurred. Used for analysis and process improvement.

---

## Event Terms

**Event**  
Any data change in the system: cost registration, forecast update, change order, quality event, baseline creation.

**Event Date**  
User-defined date when event occurred or became effective (distinct from creation timestamp).

**Audit Trail**  
Permanent record of all data changes: what, who, when, why. Immutable and non-deletable.

---

## Forecast Terms

**Forecast Type**  
Method used to create forecast:
- **Bottom-Up:** Detailed estimation from ground up
- **Performance-Based:** Using historical <|CURSOR_LOCATION|>performance trends (e.g., CPI)
- **Management Judgment:** Expert opinion/experience

**Forecast Date**  
Date when forecast was created. Must be in past. Maximum 3 per cost element.

---

## Schedule Terms

**Progression Type**  
How planned work is distributed over time:
- **Linear:** Even distribution
- **Gaussian:** Bell curve, peak at midpoint
- **Logarithmic:** Slow start, accelerating finish

**Schedule Baseline**  
Versioned record defining when work is planned. Determines PV calculations.

**Registration Date**  
Date when schedule registration was recorded. System uses latest registration ≤ control date.

---

## User Roles

**System Administrator**  
Full system access for configuration and maintenance.

**Project Manager**  
Full access to assigned projects.

**Department Manager**  
Access to department-specific cost elements.

**Project Controller**  
Read-only access for reporting and analysis.

**Executive Viewer**  
Access to summary dashboards and executive reports.
