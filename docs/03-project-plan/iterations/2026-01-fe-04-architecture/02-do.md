# DO Phase: TDD Implementation with Daily Tracking

## Purpose

Execute approved implementation using strict TDD methodology while logging progress, decisions, and deviations.

## Daily Implementation Log

### Date: 2026-01-03

**Work Completed:**

- Initialized Execution Phase.
- Started TDD for `useTableParams` hook.
- Implemented `StandardTable` component.
- Implemented `useCrud` hooks factory.
- Implemented `VersionHistory` components.
- Refactored `UserList` feature to use new generalized architecture.

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- Decision: Use `react-router-dom`'s `useSearchParams` as the source of truth for table state.
- Reasoning: Ensures deep linking and browser history support for table views (refreshing page keeps position).

**Deviations from Plan:**

- None.

**Blockers and Challenges:**

- Challenge: Integration tests for `UserList` required adding `MemoryRouter` wrapper to simulate routing context for `useTableParams`.
- Resolution: Updated test helpers in `UserList.test.tsx` to include `MemoryRouter`.

**Tomorrow's Focus:**

- Proceed to CHECK phase.
