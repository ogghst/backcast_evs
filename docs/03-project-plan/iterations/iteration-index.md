## Completed Iterations

### 2025-12-sprint-2-user-management
**Duration:** 2025-12-27 to 2025-01-10 (in progress)  
**Goal:** User Management & Quality Foundations  
**Summary:** Implemented user CRUD with versioning, achieved 81% test coverage, established quality baselines (zero linting/type errors).  
**Status:** 🔵 In Progress (Story 2.1 complete, documentation restructuring ongoing)

**Key Outcomes:**
- User management fully functional
- Quality standards established (MyPy strict, Ruff, 80%+ coverage)
- PDCA prompt templates created
- Documentation restructured to bounded-context pattern

**Learnings Applied:**
- Schema mapping pattern standardized (factory methods)
- Test organization improved
- Documentation structure prevents context rot

**Documents:**
- [Iteration Summary](2025-12-sprint-2-user-management/README.md)
- Check report available

## Pattern Recognition

**Quality Improvements:**
- Sprint 2: Invested heavily in test coverage, linting, type safety → 81% coverage, zero errors

**Documentation Evolution:**
- Sprint 2: Restructured from monolithic to bounded-context → improved maintainability

**Velocity Trends:**
- Sprint 1: 21 points (infrastructure)
- Sprint 2: ~22 points (user management + quality)

**Focus:** Versioning system foundation

### Sprint 4: Time-Travel Queries
**Estimated Start:** ~2025-02-05  
**Focus:** Historical state reconstruction
