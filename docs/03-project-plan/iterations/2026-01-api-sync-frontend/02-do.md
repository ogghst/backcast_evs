# DO Phase: TDD Implementation with Daily Tracking

## Purpose

Execute approved implementation using strict TDD methodology while logging progress, decisions, and deviations.

## Daily Implementation Log

### Date: 2026-01-02

**Work Completed:**

- Created `backend/scripts/generate_openapi.py`.
- Generated `backend/openapi.json`.
- Configured `frontend` with `openapi-typescript-codegen`.
- Generated initial client into `frontend/src/api/generated`.
- Updated backend routes with `operation_id` for cleaner method names.
- Renamed `department_id` to `department` in frontend types.
- Refactored `UserService.ts` to use generated `UsersService`.
- Refactored `api/auth.ts` to use generated `AuthenticationService`.
- Updated `Login.tsx` to handle `ApiError` format.
- Added Department column to `UserList.tsx`.
- Fixed type errors and added tests in `UserList.test.tsx`, `userService.test.ts`, `auth.test.ts`, and `Login.test.tsx`.

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- Selected `openapi-typescript-codegen` for its simplicity and popularity with FastAPI.
- Renamed `department_id` to `department` to match backend model, simplifying data mapping.
- Wrapped generated client calls in `UserService` and `api/auth.ts` adapters to maintain existing component API compatibility.

**Running Totals:**

- Tests written/updated: 4 (test files)
- Files modified: 11
- Coverage change: N/A (Maintained/Improved)
