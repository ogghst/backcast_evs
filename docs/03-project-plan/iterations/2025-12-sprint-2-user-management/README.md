# Sprint 2 Iteration Record

**Duration:** 2025-12-27 to 2025-01-10  
**Theme:** User Management & Quality Foundations  
**Status:** 🔵 In Progress

---

## Goal

Implement user management features with complete CRUD operations, authentication integration, and establish quality baselines (type safety, test coverage, linting standards).

---

## Stories Completed

### Story 2.1: User Management
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completion Date:** 2025-12-29

**Scope:**
- User CRUD endpoints with admin authorization
- User versioning (non-branching pattern)
- Command pattern implementation (Create/Update/Delete)
- Integration with authentication system
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Outcomes:**
- 39 tests passing (10 API, 1 service, 3 command, 10+ others)
- 81.57% code coverage
- Zero linting errors (Ruff)
- Zero type errors (MyPy strict mode)
- Full type hint coverage

---

## Quality Improvements (ACT Phase)

### Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Start | End | Change |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| Linting Errors | 109 | 0 | -109 ✅ |
| MyPy Errors | 47 | 0 | -47 ✅ |
| Type Hint Coverage | ~60% | 100% | +40% |
| Test Coverage | ~75% | 81.57% | +6.57% |
| Tests Passing | 32 | 39 | +7 |

### Standardizations Established

**Coding Standards:**
- Created `docs/dev/coding_standards.md`
- Ruff configuration: ignore B008 for FastAPI Depends
- MyPy strict mode required
- 80% minimum test coverage

**Schema Mapping Pattern:**
- Factory methods for complex entity→schema transformations
- Example: `UserPublic.from_entity(user)` pattern
- Documented in coding standards

**PDCA Prompts:**
- Created unified prompts combining TDD + iteration tracking
- Templates for Plan/Do/Check/Act phases
- Prompt changelog for evolution tracking

---

## Documentation Restructuring

**Completed:**
- ✅ New structure created (5 main folders + bounded contexts)
- ✅ Core files: README, vision, system-map, bounded-contexts
- ✅ PDCA prompts merged and standardized
- ✅ Cross-cutting concerns: database, API, security
- ✅ Context docs: auth, user-management
- ✅ ADR index + initial ADRs
- ✅ Current iteration tracking
- ✅ Project backlog

**Impact:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to find relevant information
- Reduced context rot through focused docs
- AI-friendly structure for PDCA cycles

---

## Learnings

### What Went Well
- Automated linting fixes (` ruff check --fix`) saved hours
- MyPy strict mode caught real bugs before tests
- Command pattern provides clear undo path (future feature)
- PDCA structure kept quality improvements systematic

### What Could Improve
- Test coverage gaps in UserService (74% coverage)
- Documentation migration took longer than planned
- Need clearer criteria for "done" on quality tasks

### Process Innovations
- Unified PDCA prompts work well for AI pairing
- Bounded context documentation prevents doc sprawl
- ADRs capture "why" effectively

---

## Metrics Summary

**Development Velocity:**
- 7 working days for Story 2.1 completion
- 39 tests written
- 100% type hint coverage achieved
- Documentation structure established

**Quality Baseline Established:**
- ✅ Zero tolerance for linting errors
- ✅ Zero tolerance for type errors
- ✅ 80% minimum test coverage enforced
- ✅ All tests must pass in CI/CD

---

## Next Iteration Implications

**Unlocked:**
- Department Management can now reference User for ownership
- Quality standards established for all future stories
- Documentation structure supports growing codebase

**Priorities for Sprint 3:**
- Apply user management patterns to Department entity
- Begin EVCS core infrastructure
- Consider improving UserService test coverage
