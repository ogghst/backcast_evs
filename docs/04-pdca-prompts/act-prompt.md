# ACT Phase: Standardization and Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Decide actions based on learnings, standardize successful patterns, and implement improvements.

---

## 1. Prioritized Improvement Implementation

Based on CHECK phase decisions, execute improvements:

### Critical Issues (Implement Immediately)
Security vulnerabilities, data integrity issues, production blockers

**For each improvement:**
- Maintain test coverage throughout changes
- Run full test suite after each modification
- Document rationale for future maintainers
- Create follow-up tasks if needed

### High-Value Refactoring
Approved design improvements that enhance maintainability

### Technical Debt Items
Address or document for future sprints

---

## 2. Pattern Standardization

Identify patterns from this implementation that should be adopted codebase-wide:

| Pattern | Description | Benefits | Risks | Standardize? |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------|--------------|
| Error handling approach | Details | Benefits | Risks | Yes/No/Pilot |
| Testing pattern | Details | Benefits | Risks | Yes/No/Pilot |
| Service structure | Details | Benefits | Risks | Yes/No/Pilot |
| Data access pattern | Details | Benefits | Risks | Yes/No/Pilot |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Human Decision Point**: For patterns marked for standardization:
>
> **Option A**: Adopt immediately, update coding standards documentation  
> **Option B**: Pilot in one more feature before standardizing  
> **Option C**: Keep as local optimization, not for wider adoption
>
> **Ask**: "Which patterns should we standardize, and at what pace?"

### Actions if Standardizing
- [ ] Update `docs/02-architecture/cross-cutting/` with new pattern
- [ ] Update coding standards
- [ ] Create examples/templates
- [ ] Schedule training session (if complex)
- [ ] Add to code review checklist

---

## 3. Documentation Updates Required

Track what documentation needs updating:

| Document | Update Needed | Priority | Assigned To | Completion Date |
|----------|---------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Architecture doc X | Add pattern Y | High/Med/Low | Name | YYYY-MM-DD |
| ADR-NNN | Create new | High/Med/Low | Name | YYYY-MM-DD |
| API Contracts | Update endpoint Z | High/Med/Low | Name | YYYY-MM-DD |

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Update `docs/02-architecture/contexts/{name}/architecture.md`
- [ ] Create new ADR for decision X
- [ ] Update cross-cutting concern doc Y
- [ ] Deprecate obsolete pattern in doc Z

---

## 4. Technical Debt Ledger

### Debt Created This Iteration
| Item | Description | Impact | Estimated Effort to Fix | Target Date |
|------|-------------|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| TD-XXX | Description | High/Med/Low | X days | YYYY-MM-DD |

### Debt Resolved This Iteration
| Item | Resolution | Time Spent |
|------|------------|------------|
| TD-YYY | How resolved | X hours |

**Net Debt Change:** +/- X items, +/- Y effort days

**Action:** Update `docs/02-architecture/technical-debt.md`

---

## 5. Process Improvements

### Process Retrospective

**What Worked Well:**
- Effective TDD practices (specific examples)
- Successful design decisions
- Smooth integration points
- Helpful tools/workflows

**What Could Improve:**
- Testing gaps discovered late
- Design decisions requiring revision
- Tooling or process friction
- Communication breakdowns

**Prompt Engineering Refinements:**
- Which prompts yielded best results?
- Where did AI need more context/constraints?
- What architectural context was missing/unclear?

### Proposed Process Changes
| Change | Rationale | Implementation | Owner |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Change X | Why needed | How to implement | Who |

**Action:** Update project plan or team practices

---

## 6. Knowledge Gaps Identified

### Team Learning Needs
- What did team struggle with?
- What documentation is missing?
- What training might help?
- What expertise should we develop?

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create knowledge-sharing session on topic X
- [ ] Document pattern Y in architecture docs
- [ ] Schedule training on technology Z
- [ ] Pair programming on skill W

---

## 7. Metrics for Next PDCA Cycle

Define success metrics for monitoring:

| Metric | Baseline (Pre-Change) | Target | Actual | Measurement Method |
|--------|----------------------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Bug rate in area | X | Y | Z | Issue tracking |
| Test coverage | X% | Y% | Z% | Coverage tool |
| Build time | X min | Y min | Z min | CI metrics |
| Response time (p95) | X ms | Y ms | Z ms | APM tool |

---

## 8. Next Iteration Implications

**What This Iteration Unlocked:**
- New capabilities enabled
- Dependencies removed
- Risks mitigated

**New Priorities Emerged:**
- Unexpected opportunities
- Newly discovered requirements

**Assumptions Invalidated:**
- What we learned that changes plans
- Course corrections needed

**Action:** Input for next meta-prompt analysis

---

## 9. Knowledge Transfer Artifacts

Create assets for team learning:
- [ ] Code walkthrough document or video
- [ ] Key decision rationale summary
- [ ] Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- [ ] Updated onboarding materials

---

## 10. Concrete Action Items

Specific, assignable tasks with owners and deadlines:

- [ ] Update `docs/02-architecture/contexts/auth/architecture.md` with new OAuth pattern (@dev1, by 2025-01-15)
- [ ] Create ADR-042 for database partitioning decision (@dev2, by 2025-01-10)
- [ ] Add technical debt item TD-099 for legacy API cleanup (@tech-lead, by 2025-01-05)
- [ ] Schedule code review session for new pattern (@team, 2025-01-12)
- [ ] Update coding standards with async/await guidelines (@dev3, by 2025-01-20)

## Success Metrics and Industry Benchmarks

Based on industry research:

| Metric | Industry Average | Our Target with PDCA+TDD | Actual This Iteration |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Defect Rate Reduction | - | 40-60% improvement | X% |
| Code Review Cycles | 3-4 | 1-2 | X |
| Rework Rate | 15-25% | < 10% | X% |
| Time-to-Production | Variable | 20-30% faster | X days |

> [!NOTE]
> **Success Story Reference**: Studies show PDCA-driven development reduces software defects by up to 61% when combined with TDD practices.
