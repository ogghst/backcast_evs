# PLAN Phase: Strategic Analysis and Iteration Planning

## Purpose
Structure iteration planning by analyzing requirements, architectural constraints, and generating implementation options for human decision.

---

## Phase 1: Context Analysis

### Documentation Review
Analyze existing documentation for alignment:
- **Product Scope** (`docs/01-product-scope/`): Unfulfilled user stories, pending requirements, business priorities
- **Architecture** (`docs/02-architecture/`): Technical debt, constraints, system capabilities and gaps  
- **Project Plan** (`docs/03-project-plan/current-iteration.md`): Recently completed work, current context, team velocity

### Codebase Analysis
Understand existing patterns:
- Current architectural patterns and conventions
- Existing test infrastructure and coverage patterns
- Dependencies and integration points
- Historical patterns for similar features

---

## Phase 2: Problem Definition

### 1. Problem Statement
- What specific problem are we solving?
- Why is it important now?
- What happens if we don't address it?
- What is the business value?

### 2. Success Criteria (Measurable)
Define **measurable acceptance criteria** verified through automated tests:

**Functional Criteria:**
- Features working as specified
- Edge cases handled
- Error conditions managed

**Technical Criteria:**
- Performance targets (response times, throughput)
- Security requirements
- Scalability needs

**Business Criteria:**
- Metrics to track
- User impact measurements

### 3. Scope Definition

**In Scope:**
- Specific features/changes
- Components affected
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates

**Out of Scope:**
- Explicitly list what we're NOT doing
- Items deferred to future iterations
- Assumptions requiring stakeholder validation

## Phase 3: Implementation Options

Generate **2-3 distinct implementation approaches**:

| Aspect | Option A | Option B | Option C (optional) |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Approach Summary** | Brief description | Brief description | Brief description |
| **Design Patterns** | Patterns applied | Patterns applied | Patterns applied |
| **Pros** | Key benefits | Key benefits | Key benefits |
| **Cons** | Trade-offs | Trade-offs | Trade-offs |
| **Test Strategy Impact** | How testing changes | How testing changes | How testing changes |
| **Risk Level** | Low/Medium/High | Low/Medium/High | Low/Medium/High |
| **Estimated Complexity** | Simple/Moderate/Complex | Simple/Moderate/Complex | Simple/Moderate/Complex |

### Recommendation
Provide recommended option with justification based on:
- Alignment with existing codebase conventions
- Long-term maintainability and extensibility
- Test coverage feasibility
- Risk mitigation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Human Decision Point**: Present options clearly and await explicit approval before proceeding.

---

## Phase 4: Technical Design

### TDD Test Blueprint
For the approved approach, outline test hierarchy:

```
├── Unit Tests (isolated component behavior)
│   ├── Happy path scenarios
│   ├── Edge cases and boundaries
│   └── Error handling
├── Integration Tests (component interactions)
│   ├── Database/repository integration
│   └── Service layer integration
└── End-to-End Tests (if applicable)
    └── Critical user flows
```

Document the first 3-5 test cases, ordered simplest to most complex.

### Implementation Strategy
- High-level approach
- Key technologies/patterns to use
- Integration points with existing system
- Component breakdown

---

## Phase 5: Risk Assessment

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk Type | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Technical | e.g., API compatibility | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Specific mitigation |
| Schedule | e.g., Dependency on external team | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Specific mitigation |
| Integration | e.g., Breaking changes | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Specific mitigation |

---

## Phase 6: Effort Estimation

### Time Breakdown
- **Development:** X hours/days
- **Testing:** X hours/days  
- **Documentation:** X hours/days
- **Review & Deployment:** X hours/days
- **Total Estimated Effort:** X days

### Prerequisites
- What must be done first?
- What documentation needs updating?
- What infrastructure is needed?
