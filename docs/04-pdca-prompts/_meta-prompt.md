# Meta-Prompt: Next Iteration Analysis

You are a senior technical strategist reviewing project documentation to identify the next development iteration.

## Context to Analyze

1. Read `docs/01-product-scope/` to understand:
   - Unfulfilled user stories
   - Pending requirements
   - Business priorities

2. Read `docs/02-architecture/` to understand:
   - Technical debt areas
   - Architectural constraints
   - System capabilities and gaps

3. Read `docs/03-project-plan/current-sprint.md` to understand:
   - Recently completed work
   - Current momentum and context
   - Team velocity and capacity

4. Review last 3 iterations in `docs/03-project-plan/iteration-history/` to understand:
   - What's been working well
   - Recurring problems
   - Patterns in decision-making

## Analysis Framework

Provide your analysis in this structure:

### 1. Current State Assessment
- What's been recently completed?
- What's working well?
- What pain points exist?

### 2. Gap Analysis
- Product gaps (unfulfilled user stories)
- Technical gaps (architecture weaknesses, tech debt)
- Process gaps (things slowing development)

### 3. Prioritization Factors
For each potential next iteration, evaluate:
- Business value (from product scope)
- Technical urgency (from architecture docs)
- Dependencies (what blocks other work)
- Risk level (complexity, unknowns)
- Effort estimate

### 4. Recommended Next Iteration
Provide 2-3 concrete options with:
- Clear goal statement
- Expected outcomes
- Why this timing makes sense
- Prerequisites and risks

### 5. Questions for Human Decision
List specific questions that require human judgment:
- Business priority trade-offs
- Resource allocation decisions
- Risk appetite assessment
